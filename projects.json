This is something that was previously considered impossible, since you cannot extract more information from what you have. The key is a trained machine learning model that has an idea of what things should look like, upscaled. Obviously the algorithm isn't perfect and does not reproduce the exact original data. The research is about whether and how these techniques could be applied in other ways. If any methods are found, prototypes of possible applications can be developed.",
